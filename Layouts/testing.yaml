      Number of confirmed positive, negative or void COVID-19 test results, by test type.  
      This is a count of test results and may include multiple tests for an individual person.  Virus tests test for 
      the presence of COVID-19 and include all pillar 1 and 2 tests and any virus tests undertaken 
      in pillar 4. Lateral flow device tests are included within pillar 2. Antibody serology tests test for COVID-19
       antibodies and include pillar 3 tests and any antibody 
      serology tests undertaken in pillar 4. Testing capacity is a projection based on reports from labs on how 
      many lab-based tests they have capacity to carry out each day based on availability of staff and resources.

      Lateral flow device tests test for the presence of COVID-19 and are swab tests that give 
      results in less than an hour, without needing to go to a laboratory. Lateral flow device tests
      have been used in trials of mass testing in schools, universities and care homes, and have been 
      available for those who live or work in Liverpool for a two-week period from 6 November 2020.
