      Number of lab-confirmed positive or negative COVID-19 test results by test type, by date reported.  This is a count of 
      test results and may include multiple tests for an individual person.  Test types include NHS and PHE tests, commercial tests, 
      antibody tests and surveillance tests.  Testing capacity is shown for the UK only and is an estimate of the number
      of tests that can be performed based on availability of staff and resources.
