      Total number of people with at least one lab-confirmed positive COVID-19 test result since the start
      of the pandemic in each area. The rates per 100,000 resident population give a fairer comparison of
      the number of cases in each area but they do not take account of the different rates of testing or
      differences in the age and sex of the local populations. Only data available for the latest reported
      date are shown.
