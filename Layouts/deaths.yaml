#  ALL CARDS THAT USE THE ORIGINAL DEATHS METRICS ARE STILL HERE PENDING A DECISION ON WHICH METRICS WE WILL BE USING
#  IF WE END UP WITH 60 DAY FOR ENGLAND WE WILL FEED THAT THROUGH USING THE EXISTING METRICS AND THESE CARDS WILL BE
#  ENGLAND AND SUB-ENGLAND ONLY.  WE WILL MOVE EXISTING PIPELINES FOR THE DAS INTO A FULL SET OF 28 DAY METRICS.

    cardType: simpleTableStatic
    fullWidth: false
    abstract: >
      Total number of deaths since the start of the pandemic of people whose death certificate mentioned
      COVID-19 as one of the causes. The underlying cause of death may not be COVID-19 in all cases. Some
      of the deceased had not had a positive test result. Only data available for the latest reported
      date are shown.  The data are published weekly by the ONS, NRS and NISRA and there is a lag in
      reporting of at least 11 days because the data are based on death registrations.
